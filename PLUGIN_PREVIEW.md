Plan ahead by scheduling expected income and expenses. See your projected balance weeks or months into the future.

## How it works

Add your recurring income and bills - paychecks, rent, subscriptions, whatever repeats. The plugin projects your balance forward, showing you exactly where you'll be financially at any point in the future. Spot potential shortfalls before they happen.

## What you'll see

- **Projected balance timeline** - See your balance 3 months, 6 months, or a year out
- **Scheduled transactions** - One-time or recurring, with flexible frequencies
- **Lowest balance warning** - Highlights when your balance might dip too low
- **Auto-suggestions** - Detects recurring patterns from your history

## Getting started

The plugin suggests recurring transactions it finds in your history. Accept the ones that apply, add any it missed, and you'll have a forecast of your future balance. Adjust the time horizon to see further ahead.
